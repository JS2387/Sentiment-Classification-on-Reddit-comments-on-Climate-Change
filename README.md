# Sentiment Classification on Reddit comments on Climate Change

## Project Abstract

This project takes the form of an investigative study in analyzing user comments posted on Reddit to determine the userâ€™s sentiment on Climate Change. The study proposed to compare the classification capabilities of simple RNNs to learn semantics \& syntactic form of the comments versus other variants like LSTMs and GRUs that capture the long-term dependencies using word embeddings from pre-trained GloVe vectors. The importance of context is showcased clearly when we combine word embeddings from GloVe with a LSTM which results in a boost in the quality of results with a f1 score of 75\% vs 72\% f1 score for a simple RNN. We attempt to improve upon the performance of the simple LSTM by replacing it with a deep GRU architecture and use dropout and pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe to receive a f1 score of 77\%.
